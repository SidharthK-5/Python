Explanation of path_finder

1. while True opens an infinte loop, first checks if path.activate() is True
2. activate() calls vector(), to get which direction the drone is going. vector() returns 1,2,3,4 according to the quadrant and 'None' if it isn't moving
3. Based on the return, activate() activates only those sensors in the direction of motion of the drone
4. activate() returns True if manginute in any direction is b/w 1 and 4. Else, False.
5. If it returns True, code works further, else, GPS coordinates are set to [0,0,0]
6. In case of True, main() calls obstacle_avoidance() next.
7. It is used to show if we are going to encounter an obstacle during motion. It sets vector magnitudes according to dist b/w drone and obstacle.
8. If resultant obtained is greater than 30, final_resultant(3) is called
9. For any magnitude > 3, it sets reslutant components to 3.
10. Then, rotate180() is called.
